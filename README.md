# Hangman Game - React App

## Description

üéÆ This is a simple Hangman game built with React. Players have to guess a secret word by suggesting letters one at a time. If too many incorrect guesses are made, the player loses the game. 

üöÄ This project is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run in any environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (recommended version 18 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/kmamaguana/my-hangman-game)
cd hangman-react
```

### 2. Local Setup without Docker (optional)

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run the project locally using Node.js.

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Run with Docker

If you'd like to run the project inside a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t hangman-react .
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 hangman-react
```

3. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains all the source code of the application.
- **public/**: Contains static files such as the `index.html` file and images of the hangman.
- **Dockerfile**: Configuration file to build a Docker image of the app.
- **.dockerignore**: List of files and directories to exclude from the Docker container (such as `node_modules`, `.git` files, etc.).
- **package.json**: Node.js configuration file with project dependencies and scripts.

## Dockerfile Explanation

- **FROM node:18-alpine**: Uses an official Node.js image (version 18, based on Alpine for a smaller size).
- **WORKDIR /app**: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
- **COPY package*.json ./**: Copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files into the container.
- **RUN npm install**: Installs the project dependencies.
- **COPY . .**: Copies the rest of the project files into the container.
- **RUN npm run build**: Builds the React app for production.
- **EXPOSE 3000**: Exposes port 3000 so that the app can be accessed externally.
- **CMD ["npm", "start"]**: Starts the application in development mode when the container is run.
